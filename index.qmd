## About Me

I’m a **Data Scientist with over 10 years of experience** building practical, production-ready solutions for multinational organizations. I’ve worked across the **finance, automotive, and education** industries, combining modeling, software development, and applied machine learning to solve real-world problems and deliver measurable business value.

At heart, I’m a **math nerd** and enjoy turning solid theory into useful, reliable systems. Lately, my work has focused on creating **high-quality embeddings** for applied AI, including **computer vision for industrial manufacturing** and **NLP-based similarity and recommendation models** that support smarter purchasing and decision-making.
