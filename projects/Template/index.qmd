# Classifying Irises by Field Measurements

*Classification is a machine learning technique used to predict group membership for data instances.
The problem concerns the identification of IRIS plant species on the
basis of plant attribute measurements. Classification of IRIS data set would be discovering patterns
from examining petal and sepal size of the IRIS plant and how the prediction was made from analyzing the
pattern to form the class of IRIS plant. By using this pattern and classification, it is possible to
accurately predict the IRIS Species. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been
deployed to perform classification of datasets efficiently. In this work, dimensionality
reduction techniques such as PCA will be used in conjunction with SVM to classify.*

## Introduction

Bio-informatics is a promising and novel research area in the 21st century. This field is data
driven and aims at understanding of relationships and gaining knowledge in biology. In order to
extract this knowledge encoded in biological data, advanced computational technologies,
algorithms and tools need to be used. Basic problems in bio-informatics like protein structure
prediction, multiple alignments of sequences, phylogenic inferences, etc are inherently nondeterministic polynomial-time hard in nature. To solve these kinds of problems artificial
intelligence (AI) methods offer a powerful and efficient approach. Researchers have used AI
techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, and
Support Vector Machines to solve problems in bio-informatics.

The concern of this study is towards the identification of IRIS plants on the basis of the
following measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
This paper is mainly concerned with an analysis of the performance results of classification techniques
such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) in determining the species of the Iris plants.

## Data

One of the most popular and best known databases of the neural network application is the IRIS
plant data set which is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository and created by R.A.
Fisher while donated by Michael Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU@io.arc.nasa.gov) on July, 1988

The IRIS dataset classifies three different classes of IRIS plant by performing pattern
classification. The IRIS data set includes three classes of 50 objects each, where each class
refers to a type of IRIS plant. The attributed that already been predicted belongs to the class of
IRIS plant. The list of attributes present in the IRIS can be described as categorical, nominal and
continuous. The experts have mentioned that there isnâ€™t any missing value found in any attribute
of this data set. The data set is complete.

This project makes use of the well known IRIS dataset, which refers to three classes of 50
instances each, where each class refers to a type of IRIS plant. The first of the classes is linearly
distinguishable from the remaining two, with the second two not being linearly separable from
each other. The 150 instances, which are equally separated between the three classes, contain the
following four numeric attributes:


```{python}
#| tbl-cap: Iris Measures
data = get_data("iris")
decoder = ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']
```

The fifth attribute is the predictive attributes which is the class attribute that means each instance
also includes an identifying class name, each of which is one of the following: IRIS Setosa, IRIS
Versicolour, or IRIS Virginica.


```{python}
report = data.profile_report(progress_bar=False, title="Iris EDA Report")
report.to_file("assets/Iris_EDA.html", silent = True)
```

## Methods

Dimensionality reduction is a really important concept in Machine Learning since
it reduces the number of features in a dataset and hence reduces the
computations needed to fit the model. **PCA** is one of the well known efficient
dimensionality reduction techniques. in this tutorial we will use PCA which
compresses the data by projecting it to a new subspace that can help in reducing
the effect of the **curse of dimensionality**. Our dataset consists of
4 dimensions(4 features) so we will project it to a 2 dimensions space and
plot it for visualization.

```{python}
env = setup(data, target="species", train_size = .8, session_id = RANDOM_STATE, pca=True, pca_components = 2, verbose = False, normalize = True)
```

```{python}
#| tbl-cap: Reduced Dimension Measurements
env.X_transformed.head()
```

The first principle component has the highest explained variance, followed by the 2nd component. By plotting these 2 components, we get a view of the 4 dimensions with as much explained variance as possible for a linear transformation. Although not a guarantee to be beneficial, often as in this case, clear separation of the target class can be observed in the transformed subspace.

```{python}
pca = env.pipeline[-1].transformer 
plt.figure()
sns.scatterplot(env.X_transformed, x="pca0", y="pca1", hue=data["species"]).set(title="IRIS Species Scatter Plot \n Explained Variance: %.3f" % pca.explained_variance_ratio_.sum())
```
