I am a pragmatic and results-oriented Data Scientist with over 10 years of experience across the automotive, finance, and education sectors, delivering production-grade machine learning solutions. Passionate about solving real-world problems using statistical modeling, computer vision, and NLP. Proven ability to lead cross-functional projects, to design and implement robust MLOps pipelines using Databricks, Docker, and CI/CD best practices. I'm adept at working in collaborative environments and translating complex data into strategic business outcomes.

### Data Scientist III
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
#### DENSO International America, INC. Maryville, TN	July 2018 – Present

 - Architected and deployed predictive maintenance systems for critical manufacturing components using vibration analytics and time-to-failure modeling, mitigating ~396 hours of annual downtime and delivering $178K+ in documented cost avoidance.
 - Built end-to-end computer vision defect detection pipelines using segmentation-based CNNs and convolutional autoencoders; deployed containerized Flask APIs integrated with robotic process control (OPCUA), contributing to $1.2M+ in operational impact.
 - Led enterprise Databricks implementation for time-series analytics and ML workloads, leveraging MLflow, Unity Catalog, and automated data quality pipelines for governed model lifecycle management.
 - Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitLab) to automate testing, validation, containerization, and deployment of ML models and API endpoints to production environments.
 - Developed NLP solutions using sentence embeddings and UMAP clustering to structure unstandardized procurement data, improving spend visibility and identifying $75K+ in cost avoidance opportunities.
 - Contributed to development of a tariff rules engine supporting real-time and scenario-based analysis, enabling data-driven strategy with reported impact exceeding $140M.
 - Collaborated with MIT to model supply chain resilience using Gurobi optimization and GIS datasets, informing disaster risk mitigation and scenario planning.
 - Architected and deployed an Enterprise CI/CD pipeline with Azure Devops and Databricks, to automate testing and deployment of ML applications
 - Mentored and led junior data scientists in production ML delivery, establishing standardized experiment tracking, CI/CD workflows, and deployment practices.
