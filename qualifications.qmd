### Data Scientist III
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
#### DENSO International America, INC. Maryville, TN	July 2018 – Present

- Collaborated with MIT to simulate and analyze supply chain resilience using Gurobi and GIS datasets, informing risk mitigation plans for natural disasters.
- Developed a computer vision defect detection system using segmentation-based CNNs and convolutional autoencoders, deployed via Flask, containerized, and integrated for robotic process control using OPCUA, reducing defect rates and human inspection costs.
- Led deployment of Databricks-based pipelines for time series analysis and predictive maintenance, leveraging Data Quality Pipelines, MLflow for experiment tracking, and Unity Catalog for data and model asset management.
- Built NLP models using sentence embeddings and UMAP for clustering procurement descriptions, improving spend visibility and optimizing purchasing processes.
- Led the Data Science Internship Program, handling hiring, project scoping, daily standups, and mentorship; delivered production-quality NLP and analytics solutions while establishing training resources and workflows for future prospects.
- Accurately forecasted the COVID-19 case peak using an SEIR model 16 months in advance (8-day margin of error), enabling proactive workforce planning and minimizing disruption to manufacturing operations.
- Established an Enterprise CI/CD pipeline using Azure Devops with Databricks, as well as GitLab with Docker to automate testing and deployment of ML applications with API endpoints
