    "text": "Introduction\nBio-informatics is a promising and novel research area in the 21st century. This field is data driven and aims at understanding of relationships and gaining knowledge in biology. In order to extract this knowledge encoded in biological data, advanced computational technologies, algorithms and tools need to be used. Basic problems in bio-informatics like protein structure prediction, multiple alignments of sequences, phylogenic inferences, etc are inherently nondeterministic polynomial-time hard in nature. To solve these kinds of problems artificial intelligence (AI) methods offer a powerful and efficient approach. Researchers have used AI techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, and Support Vector Machines to solve problems in bio-informatics.\nThe concern of this study is towards the identification of IRIS plants on the basis of the following measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This paper is mainly concerned with an analysis of the performance results of classification techniques such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) in determining the species of the Iris plants."

Fisher while donated by Michael Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU@io.arc.nasa.gov) on July, 1988\nThe IRIS dataset classifies three different classes of IRIS plant by performing pattern classification. The IRIS data set includes three classes of 50 objects each, where each class refers to a type of IRIS plant. The attributed that already been predicted belongs to the class of IRIS plant. The list of attributes present in the IRIS can be described as categorical, nominal and continuous. The experts have mentioned that there isn’t any missing value found in any attribute of this data set. The data set is complete.\nThis project makes use of the well known IRIS dataset, which refers to three classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of IRIS plant. The first of the classes is linearly distinguishable from the remaining two, with the second two not being linearly separable from each other. The 150 instances, which are equally separated between the three classes, contain the following four numeric attributes:\n\n\nCode\ndata = get_data(\"iris\")\ndecoder = ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris Measures\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nIris-setosa\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nIris-setosa\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nIris-setosa\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nIris-setosa\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nIris-setosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth attribute is the predictive attributes which is the class attribute that means each instance also includes an identifying class name, each of which is one of the following: IRIS Setosa, IRIS Versicolour, or IRIS Virginica.\n\n\nCode\nreport = data.profile_report(progress_bar=False, title=\"Iris EDA Report\")\nreport.to_file(\"../../assets/Iris_EDA.html\", silent = True)"

    "text": "Methods\nDimensionality reduction is a really important concept in Machine Learning since it reduces the number of features in a dataset and hence reduces the computations needed to fit the model. PCA is one of the well known efficient dimensionality reduction techniques. in this tutorial we will use PCA which compresses the data by projecting it to a new subspace that can help in reducing the effect of the curse of dimensionality. Our dataset consists of 4 dimensions(4 features) so we will project it to a 2 dimensions space and plot it for visualization.\n\n\nCode\nenv = setup(data, target=\"species\", train_size = .8, session_id = RANDOM_STATE, pca=True, pca_components = 2, verbose = False, normalize = True)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.X_transformed.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Dimension Measurements\n\n\n\npca0\npca1\n\n\n\n\n127\n1.021534\n0.097576\n\n\n111\n1.605931\n-0.399031\n\n\n104\n1.869498\n0.330141\n\n\n92\n0.338219\n-0.972368\n\n\n68\n1.232189\n-1.617687\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first principle component has the highest explained variance, followed by the 2nd component. By plotting these 2 components, we get a view of the 4 dimensions with as much explained variance as possible for a linear transformation. Although not a guarantee to be beneficial, often as in this case, clear separation of the target class can be observed in the transformed subspace.\n\n\nCode\npca = env.pipeline[-1].transformer
